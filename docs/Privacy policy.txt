Yo. This is the super professional privacy policy.
So, here's how it goes:

You, the user, is in entire control of what information goes into the app and what information goes out of the app. By your own free will, you import your images, and those images, unless explicitly exported - along with their app based metadata - stay within your system or stored across your OneDrive (OneDrive, where applicable. You may not have this feature enabled through your system settings)

These exported data files can be sent through third party means to other users, indivuduals, or companies and that is beyond my, the developer's, scope of liability.

Stored within your app are dates in which you completed your workouts or tasks but are solely used for informing the user of their accomplishments.

Through the app itself, excluding the Windows store or cloud to file based Windows services, this app does NOT access the Internet.

Should a situation arise that your files are compromised, they contain no person information, unless your own pictures or descriptions used within the app do.
